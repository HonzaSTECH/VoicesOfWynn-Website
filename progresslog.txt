PLANS:
------
Rather simplistic looking website cuz idk... might fit -
shouldn't have a very complex design -
colorcodes function as placeholders (easy to change later and i'm too lazy to decide on a colorpalette from the start) -
look closer into animations -
make it mostly Wynncraft styled -


NOTES:
------
if i continue to run into severe problems daily i might not have the mental power to continue
i hope this doesnt severely fuck up my sleep schedule (that would really be great)
i should maybe have a strict schedule as to when i do what
i shall not touch php ever again :')
might want to remove all unecesary comments


PROGRESS SORTED BY DAYS:
------------------------
10/27 - meh 
10/28 - decent i guess... i made some neat changes and kinda got more into the navigation

[Note to self]: Work through halloween, progress wasnt too great today. cant work on the website tomorrow and on saturday - plans for 31st:
                ~ take a look at all the public accessible pages and edit them
                ~ if theres some time remaining, clean up code and remove unecesary comments
                ~ after i edited all the publicly accessible files i will "wynncraftify" the page, as said colorcodes work as 
                  placeholders right now
                ~ if thats too much for the one day, split it into less necesary and more necesary, login is less important for example
