PLANS:
------
Center cards in credits
check why tf icons wont work... tried on my personal workspace, everything worked fine
overlapping problem still is quite annoying in /credits and /contents


NOTES:
------
all screen sizes are below my screen size. I know that everything above that will work just fine. For most
laptops no changes need to be made, however there still are people lurking some where around the world that
still use 14" laptops and because of them i have a lot more work to do >:(


PROGRESS SORTED BY DAYS:
------------------------
10/27 - meh 
10/28 - decent i guess... i made some neat changes and kinda got more into the navigation
10/31 to 12/3 - uh... I got the job :D    other than that, decent progress
12/7 - good progress, started work on login and Administration, got the font to work
12/26 - forgot to enter the one or the other day, but progress was decent, mainly consisted of endless frustration
        because nothing wants to work

[Note to self]: want to finish website before christmas (hmmmm didnt work out so well huh?)
                finally found a better way to have a preview for multiple screen sizes - no need to use extensions anymore
                    vow.local --> inspect element --> the weird screen icon right next to the exit button (and yes, i had to write that down i WILL forget it)
