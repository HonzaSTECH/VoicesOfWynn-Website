PLANS:
------
Rather simplistic looking website cuz idk... might fit -
shouldn't have a very complex design -
colorcodes function as placeholders (easy to change later and i'm too lazy to decide on a colorpalette from the start) -
look closer into animations -
make it mostly Wynncraft styled -


NOTES:
------
if i continue to run into severe problems daily i might not have the mental power to continue
i hope this doesnt severely fuck up my sleep schedule (that would really be great)
i should maybe have a strict schedule as to when i do what
i shall not touch php ever again :')
might want to remove all unecesary comments


PROGRESS SORTED BY DAYS:
------------------------
10/27 - meh
