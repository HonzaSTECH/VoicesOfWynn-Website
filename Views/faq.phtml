<div class="faq-element question-bubble">How many characters are voiced in the mod?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>Currently, all quest NPCs are voiced. We‚Äôre hard at work keeping all quest dialogues up to date while adding dialogues to non-quest NPCs.</p>
	<p>In addition to quest NPCs, we‚Äôve also added full voice acting for the Seaskipper Captain and the Talking Mushroom. Other significant NPCs will be added soon!</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">Do you plan to voice all NPCs in Wynncraft?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>We‚Äôre currently adding voices to Secret Discoveries. The next thing on our agenda is boss altars and dungeons. After that, it is our hope that we will voice all NPCs with white name tags that players are most likely to talk to. It‚Äôs not likely we‚Äôll do every single one.</p>

<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">I think that a certain NPC‚Äôs voice doesn‚Äôt fit.</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>We‚Äôre always appreciative of feedback. Some roles were cast early in the mod, when we had much lower standards for performances. One way to signal which NPCs need revoicing is to vote for the recordings in <a href="contents">Mod Contents</a>. Click the name of any NPC and navigate down to the recording of your choice. There, you can also leave comments with feedback for the voice actors. Keep in mind that, if you are not logged into the site, your IP address will be stored to prevent abuse.</p>

<div class="faq-element question-bubble">Some dialogue isn‚Äôt playing. Where can I report it?</div>
<div class="faq-element answer-bubble">
	<p>Be aware that some dialogue, such as pre-and-post-quest dialogue is not voiced. However, all dialogue during a quest should be voiced, and if not you should report it. <a href="https://discord.gg/kuEK3XH4Y5" target="_blank">Join our Discord server</a> and navigate down to <b style="white-space:nowrap;">#üö®bugs-and-suggestionsüí°.</b></p>
