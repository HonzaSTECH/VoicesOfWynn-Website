This open directory serves as a testing server
for Voices of Wynn Core. Files saved in this
directory and its subdirectories are requested
by the mod (working as a client) and dynamically
downloaded for the mod user to use.

You can browse through the files, but you won't
really find anything secret here. But hey, if
you're a techy type who likes to snoop around,
why not let us know on our Discord and help us
out with the project.
